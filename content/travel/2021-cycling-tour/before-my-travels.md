I am planning my route and getting my things together. There's more things to do than I initially anticipated. The route has roughly been planned out, though I think I will keep adjusting it as I go along.

## The Route

The plan is to go through Grisons into Italy, cycle in the dolomites over to the slovenian alps, up to Vienna and then through Austria and parts of Germany back to Switzerland. In total I have about 1 month of time for this trip.
