Today I had to climb over two passes, quite a plan for the second day, at least for me it was. First up to Flüelapass, then down, through Zernez and right after came the Ofenpass through to Val Müstair. The day was exhausting, ur I was rewarded with beautiful views all the way through, so I had many opportunities to take a photo.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
