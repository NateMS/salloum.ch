At about 8 in the morning I had all things packed and went on my way towards the mountains. It was a cloudy day, sometimes even a bit cold, but not too bad. I managed to go a good bit towards the mountains and the bike is going well. I have found a nice camping spot right at the Lake „Walensee“ with a great view. After a long day of cycling I could cool down in the cold water.
