It was a rainy day from the morning until the afternoon. After packing up my tent in the rain I started riding towards Innsbruck. I am reasonably well prepared for the bad weather, but things still get wet and it‘s also quite a bit colder than just a few days ago. I also feel it in the night, the sleeping bag is not quite good enough for lower temperatures. After about 35 km of riding I couldn‘t continue on with my route, apparently an Iron Man race is going on and the blocked the road completely. So I could either wait for 3 hours or look for an alternative. Since this was in a valley with high mountains on both sides there was no other road I could take, meanwhile the cars could go on the highway. Luckily there was a train station nearby, and after just 8 minutes a train arrived and I rode along for about three stops, for about 20 kilometers. But while I could cycle again, the race was still nearby and I was faces with various road blockings where I had to be careful or drive around them. Once passed, the ride was all good again. By this point I would have been able to see mountains all around me, instead I only saw a grey sky and fog, the rivers were brown and flowing with lots of water and debris from the rain. Once at the camping, I had a pleasant surprise. They have a little hut I could sleep in (for a bit extra), so I wouldn’t have to sleep in the tent for the night. This allowed me to dry my tent and my clothes for a bit, so I should be all good again for the next day. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
